## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
My name is Camillo, and I'm a full-stack developer based in Berlin, Germany. Although I started my career as a graphic designer, I've always had a profound interest in innovation and technology. This passion led me to transition into the tech industry, where I've been able to blend my creative skills with my love for coding. I specialize in creating seamless, user-friendly digital experiences, drawing upon my background in design to enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of the applications I develop. Living in a city known for its vibrant tech scene has further fueled my desire to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and continuously challenge myself to learn and grow as a developer.
